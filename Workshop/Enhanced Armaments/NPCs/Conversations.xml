        <Conversation line="Damn, I hope we aren't on the receiving end of them then." speaker="1">

  <Conversation line="Any of you wondered why the sub mounted Machine Gun turret's only in 7.62?" speaker="0" maxintensity="0.3">
    <Conversation line="Not really sure, you'd think they'd go for something a bit beefier? There's a lot of ammo in the boxes but they aren't the most effective option." speaker="1">

      </Conversation>
    </Conversation>
    <Conversation line="It's meant to be a really cheap, power efficient means of slinging lead at things, I suppose they chose 7.62 because it's a lot easier to bulk manufacture." speaker="1" allowedjobs="securityofficer">
      <Conversation line="Now granted something a lot bigger calibre would be really cool, but Coilguns are kinda everywhere now and MG turrets are sorta legacy options." speaker="1">

        <Conversation line="Yeah I'm... concerned, at no point has there been this many weapons, a heavily armed Europa is a dangerous Europa..." speaker="0">
          <Conversation line="You seen how the crawler and mudraptor populations have completely shrunk? I really blame guns for it, this is actively causing moon-wide issues." speaker="1">

      <Conversation line="Not when said security is in the hands of a maniac... You know the opiate problem on Europa and arming almost everyone I think is a horrible idea." speaker="0">

        <Conversation line="I think that's a horrible idea, giving every man, woman and child their own weapon seems incredibly uneccessary and dangerous." speaker="0">
