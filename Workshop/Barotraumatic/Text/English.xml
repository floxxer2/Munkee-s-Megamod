  <entityname.ekutility_advancedheadset>Advanced Headset</entityname.ekutility_advancedheadset>
  <entitydescription.ekutility_advancedheadset>The perfect headset. Equipped with noise suppression, high frequency emitters, and adjustable comfort suspension, this headset is designed for onboard use by submarine crews muffling loud noises and improving quiet ones when using dive suits while protecting the users hearing and inner ear. 250m Range</entitydescription.ekutility_advancedheadset>
  <entityname.batterycelldisposable>Disposable Battery Cell</entityname.batterycelldisposable>
  <entitydescription.batterycelldisposable>A dangerous attempt at solving the portable power crisis on Europa, This high output rechargeable chemical battery is prone to thermal run away and explode when used continously or when struck against a hard surface. Though it can be placed on a charger, if it begins to smoke it may be safer to just deconstruct or throw it away immediately.</entitydescription.batterycelldisposable>
  <entityname.ekutility_longrangeradio>Long Range Radio Backpack</entityname.ekutility_longrangeradio>
  <entitydescription.ekutility_longrangeradio>A portable radio pack. Equipped with noise suppression, rotating high frequency emitters, and adjustable comfort suspension, this headset is designed for onboard use by submarine crews its atomic pile will last for years of constant use, while only slowing the wearer down a small amount. In addition to the general carrying space there are two ammo pouches and the headset 'ear scout' system drastically reduces divesuit muffling. 800m Range</entitydescription.ekutility_longrangeradio>
  <entityname.ek_security_radio>Walkie Talkie</entityname.ek_security_radio>
  <entitydescription.ek_security_radio>A low-profile radio transceiver used mainly by ship and station security officers, this coalition special forces setup is excellent for diving teams as the long range radio frequency minimizes distortions from naturally occurring sources by using ULF in a relatively compact package. 400m Range</entitydescription.ek_security_radio>
  <entitydescription.BTCpressureinjectorheadset>A field modifed injector headset designed specifically for pressure stabilizer, quickly injects the wearer if it detects Organ Damage while under High Pressure. Monitors the users vitals and sends out a SOS beacon should they become incapciatated including paralyzation or heart conditions, which will disengage once the user is stabilized or expires. 200m Range</entitydescription.BTCpressureinjectorheadset>
  <Override>
    <entitydescription.autoinjectorheadset>A modifed headset utilizing an integrated battery, capable of injecting medicine placed within once the user's vitals drop to a certain level. Monitors the users vitals and sends out a SOS beacon should they become incapciatated including paralyzation or heart conditions, which will disengage once the user is stabilized or expires. 200m Range</entitydescription.autoinjectorheadset>
