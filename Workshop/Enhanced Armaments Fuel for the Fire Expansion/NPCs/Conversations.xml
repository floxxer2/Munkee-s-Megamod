    <Conversation line="Me too, I've found bodies riddled with holes and surrounded by casings, but I heard no shots." speaker="1" flags="OutpostNPCSeparatists" />
    <Conversation line="Aye, had to clean up after those guys once, 'least those sorry saps died fast. Nasty sights, those were." speaker="1" flags="OutpostNPCSeparatists" />
    <Conversation line="That implies they've been seen." speaker="1" flags="OutpostNPCSeparatists" />

  <Conversation line="Damn it, where's my Shotgun?" speaker="0" allowedjobs="securityofficer">
    <Conversation line="Which one? There's like, five different ones in the armory!" speaker="1" />
    <Conversation line="I left it in the armory. Look into more shells soon, we're running low." speaker="1" allowedjobs="securityofficer" />
    <Conversation line="What, need to yank it to get the blood going?" speaker="1" speakertags="laid-back,joker">
      <Conversation line="...Pipe up like that again, and you'll be pissing scattershot, IF you can find your bits later." speaker="0" />

  <Conversation line="What's with all the new stuff on the market? Weren't there enough as-is?" speaker="0">
    <Conversation line="Those pistols pack a punch, sure, but it goes both ways if you can't hold them right." speaker="1" />
    <Conversation line="The Shotguns would be perfect, if I didn't have to realign my shoulder afterwards." speaker="1" />
    <Conversation line="Is there going to be Wild West: Electric Boogaloo or something?" speaker="1" speakertags="joker,crazy">

  <Conversation line="Ever heard of Vanguards? Nasty pieces of work working for the Separatists." speaker="0">
    <Conversation line="I have and I'll tell you now I never want to meet one, I've heard a lot of stories about them and how they pretty much shred every assaulting Coalition vessel that dares come across them." speaker="1" />
    <Conversation line="Fingers crossed we don't have to run into any then..." speaker="0" />
    <Conversation line="Alright enough about the furry wannabe spec ops, we have a job to do." speaker="2" allowedjobs="captain" />

  <Conversation line="Why does the Coalition not have any special forces unlike the Separatists?" speaker="0">
    <Conversation line="No idea, probably because they don't need them." speaker="1" />
    <Conversation line="You'd think a PMC would have formed by now and filled that niche?" speaker="0" />
    <Conversation line="Given how hellish the political situation is I can sort of see that being a market that's going to skyrocket soon, trained contractors for better security when shit hits the fan." speaker="1" />
    <Conversation line="Eh... now that I think about it I really doubt the Coalition, as Beureaucratic as it is, would be willing to allow PMCs to take their place, too much potential for corruption." speaker="0" />

  <Conversation line="Let's get a tonne of Condensed Ethanol and get the medic to down it all!" speaker="0">

  <Conversation line="Preso Latex is a horrible thing, why the hell was it even made?" speaker="0">
    <Conversation line="I have no idea, apparently it's got this weird mutagenic... I think that's the word... affect on human tissue." speaker="1" />
    <Conversation line="Refrain from touching the latex stocks please, it's marked 'Chemical Hazard' for a reason, I don't want to have to use all the Stabilozine and watch the whole crew petrify." speaker="2" allowedjobs="medicaldoctor" />
    <Conversation line="Trust me doc' by no means am I going anywhere near your fetishist nightmare material, I already have enough on my mind." speaker="0" />
    <Conversation line="I'm not going to entertain your strange opinion on it." speaker="2" allowedjobs="medicaldoctor" />

  <Conversation line="Which gun is best?" speaker="0">
    <Conversation line="I'd have to say our SMGs, big calibre and good for basic defense, though the barrel's kinda shitty." speaker="1" />
    <Conversation line="No way Pistols are the go-to, I can throw it in my toolbelt and I have a fully-semi gun ready to go with a half action trigger." speaker="0" />
    <Conversation line="I don't know about pistols they're pretty bad for pretty much anything other than self-defence, even though I've been told it'll blow a lung out of the body no problem." speaker="1" />

  <Conversation line="What's next in the line of small arms development?" speaker="0" />
  <Conversation line="I'm betting something to do with all of this weird chemical weaponry stuff that's slowly becoming more prevalent." speaker="0" />
  <Conversation line="Nah, definitely hand-held rail and coil weaponry, once Fulgurium becomes a lot more understood we'll be walking around with some pretty powerful kit. Chemical weapons only get you so far." speaker="1" allowedjobs="securityofficer">
    <Conversation line="I'm no gun guy so all bets are off for me." speaker="0" />

      <Conversation line="A mask that claims the life of many-a-unfortunate sailor apparently.." speaker="0">
        <Conversation line="Alright it's probably best I try not to freak everyone out." speaker="0" />
        <Conversation line="I have no clue what either of you are on about, I'll be honest." speaker="2" />
