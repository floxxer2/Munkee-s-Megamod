  <entityname.sgt_n99>The Wanderer</entityname.sgt_n99>
  <entitydescription.sgt_n99>This 10x25mm pistol has seen some better days, with dents and scratches from every discernable source, but just as reliable as ever. Recoil is extremely manageable, so don't worry about a Kick in the Head.</entitydescription.sgt_n99>

  <entitydescription.sgt_s63>Another work-around to use Coalition ammunition stores, this 5.56x45 LMG can take both Coalition standard rifle magazines and belt boxes. It's assembly is crude at best, so don't expect much from it.</entitydescription.sgt_s63>

  <entitydescription.sgt_rifle>A stark comparison to the more reliable bolt-action Coalition counterpart, it has a deeper internal magazine, with a self-actuating bolt. The gas system is notably unreliable, and pulls enough away from the round to cause decreased performance. A skilled Rifleman can make better use of this weapon.</entitydescription.sgt_rifle>
